= The Stormpot Release Process

This is not really documentation, but rather an "internal" document detailing the release process, so that I don't forget any steps.

* [ ] Create an issue tracking the release.
      See for instance https://github.com/chrisvest/stormpot/issues/70
* [ ] Fix all the issues
* [ ] Update & review the javadoc & documentation
* [ ] Create a branch for the new version
* [ ] Remove any existing tag for upcoming version (locally: `git tag -d stormpot-2.2`, remotely: `git push origin :refs/tags/stormpot-2.2`)
* [ ] `mvn release:clean`
* [ ] `mvn release:prepare` (If rollback is needed: `git reset --hard HEAD^`, `git push -f` and check `git log`)
* [ ] `mvn release:perform`
* [ ] "Close" staged release in the staging repo: https://oss.sonatype.org/
* [ ] "Release" staged release
* [ ] Check out the release tag and run `./docupdate.sh`
* [ ] Announce on mailing list & write blog post
